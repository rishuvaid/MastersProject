To create Demos using DemoCreation

1) Create and export ‘geojson’ and ‘json’ of the data needed in the demo using ‘TrafficDensity’ or ‘TrafficDirection’.

Geojson- contains geometry of hexagons and the count in each hexagon
json- contains hexagon id associated to the count in it.

2) Import all the ‘geojson’ and ‘json’ files (created in step1) needed in the demo and export the html file using DemoCreation.

3) Use javascript to switch between different layers of the demo as done in ‘demo_density_1.html’ and ‘demo_direction1.html’.
